    <h2>Loving Animals:</h2>
    <p>Animals are wonderful creatures of nature.</p>
    <p>They are essential to maintain a balance in our environment.</p>
    <p> We should not harm them through activities like hunting or poaching. </p>
    <p> All living beings should be protected and loved. They should not be disturbed by any human intervention. </p>
