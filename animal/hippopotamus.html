    <h2>
        Habitat:
    </h2>
    <p>Hippos are semi-aquatic mammals found in sub-Saharan Africa, where they inhabit rivers, lakes, and swamps. They
        are most commonly found in freshwater habitats.</p>
    <h2>Physical Characteristics:</h2>
    <p>Size: Hippos are among the largest land mammals. They can weigh between 1,500 to 3,200 kilograms (3,300 to 7,000
        pounds) and can stand around 4.5 to 5 feet tall at the shoulder.</p>
    <p>Shape: They have a barrel-shaped body with short legs and a relatively large head. Their skin is largely
        hairless, grayish, and thick, which helps protect them from the sun and abrasions.</p>
    <p>Mouth and Teeth: Hippos have large mouths filled with sharp, ivory-like teeth. Their canines and incisors can
        grow quite long and are used for defense and territorial displays.</p>
    <h2>Behavior:</h2>
    <p>Semi-Aquatic Lifestyle: Hippos spend much of their time in the water, usually in the daytime to avoid the heat.
        They are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for several minutes</p>
    <p>Nocturnal Feeding: They are primarily nocturnal grazers. At night, they venture out of the water to feed on
        grasses and other vegetation, covering significant distances.</p>
    <p>Social Structure: Hippos are social animals that live in groups of varying sizes. These groups are led by a
        dominant male, and they establish territories within water bodies.</p>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Despite their massive size, hippos are herbivores. Their diet consists mainly of grasses, which they consume in
        large quantities.</p>
    <h2>Reproduction</h2>
    <p>Birth: Female hippos give birth to a single calf, usually in the water. The calf can weigh between 25 to 50
        kilograms (55 to 110 pounds) and can swim shortly after birth.</p>
    <p>Maternal Care: Mother hippos are protective of their young and keep them close. Calves are often seen riding on
        their mother's back in the water.</p>
    <h2>Conservation Status:</h2>
    <p>Hippos are currently classified as "Vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
        They face threats such as habitat loss, human encroachment, and poaching for their ivory teeth.</p>
    <h2>Interesting Facts:</h2>
    <p>Despite their aquatic nature, hippos are not related to whales or dolphins. Instead, they are more closely
        related to pigs and other artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates).</p>
    <p>Hippos have a reputation for being aggressive and territorial, especially when protecting their young or their
        water territories.</p>
    <p>Overall, hippos are iconic African animals with a unique combination of aquatic and terrestrial behaviors. They
        play an important role in their ecosystems by creating pathways through aquatic vegetation and providing
        nutrients to aquatic systems through their waste.</p>
