<h1>Crab</h1>
<img src="imges/crab.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Crabs are crustaceans known for their distinctive sideways walking, hard exoskeleton, and varied habitats.</p>

<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Body Structure: Crabs have a hard exoskeleton that protects their body. They have ten limbs, including two pincers, called chelae.</li>
  <li>Walking Style: Crabs move sideways, or laterally, due to the structure of their legs, which allows for efficient movement on land and in water.</li>
  <li>Molting: As crabs grow, they shed their exoskeleton in a process called molting, allowing them to develop a larger one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Habitat: Crabs inhabit various environments, including oceans, freshwater bodies, and terrestrial habitats like forests and deserts.</li>
  <li>Feeding Habits: They are omnivores and scavengers, feeding on a range of food items including algae, mollusks, small fish, and detritus.</li>
  <li>Nocturnal Behavior: Many crab species are more active during the night, when they forage and search for food.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Crabs have a diverse diet that can include plant matter, other small animals, and detritus.</p>

<h2>Conservation Status</h2>
<p>Crabs play essential roles in marine ecosystems, and certain crab populations may be affected by habitat loss, pollution, and overfishing.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Regeneration: Crabs are known for their ability to regenerate limbs if they are damaged or lost.</li>
  <li>Fiddler Crabs: Male fiddler crabs have one greatly enlarged claw, which they use for communication and attracting mates.</li>
  <li>Hermit Crabs: Hermit crabs protect their soft abdomens by using empty shells as makeshift shelters.</li>
</ul>
