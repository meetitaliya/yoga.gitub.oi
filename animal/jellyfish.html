<h1>Jellyfish</h1>
<img src="imges/jellyfish.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Jellyfish are fascinating marine creatures known for their gelatinous bodies and graceful movements in the water.</p>

<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Body Structure: Jellyfish have a gelatinous bell-shaped or umbrella-like body called a medusa.</li>
  <li>Tentacles: They have long, trailing tentacles that contain specialized cells called cnidocytes, which release venom to capture prey.</li>
  <li>Translucent Appearance: Jellyfish are often translucent or transparent, allowing light to pass through their bodies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Habitat: Jellyfish are found in oceans worldwide, from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea.</li>
  <li>Movement: They use a pulsating motion of their bell to propel themselves through the water, often drifting with ocean currents.</li>
  <li>Stinging Cells: The tentacles of jellyfish contain stinging cells that can deliver painful stings to predators and even humans.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Jellyfish are carnivorous and feed on plankton, small fish, and other small organisms that they capture with their tentacles.</p>

<h2>Conservation Status</h2>
<p>Jellyfish populations can fluctuate due to factors such as climate change, pollution, and overfishing of their predators.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Life Cycle: Jellyfish have a complex life cycle involving both a stationary polyp stage and a free-swimming medusa stage.</li>
  <li>Bioluminescence: Some jellyfish species are bioluminescent, emitting light in the dark depths of the ocean.</li>
  <li>Non-Brain Structure: Jellyfish lack a centralized brain, but they have a simple nerve net that helps them respond to their environment.</li>
</ul>
