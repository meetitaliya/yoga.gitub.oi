    <p>Zebras are mammals of the family Equidae. Zebras are African horses. They are in the same genus as the common
        horse, Equus caballus, and donkeys. Zebras are known for having many black and white stripes. There are three
        main species of zebra, Grevy's Zebra, the Plains Zebra, and the Mountain Zebra. </p>
    <h1>Species</h1>
    <h2>Genus Equus</h2>
    <h3>Grevy's Zebra (Equus grevyi)</h3>
    <h3>Plains Zebra (Equus quagga)</h3>
    <p>-Crawshay’s Zebra (Equus quagga crawshaii)</p>
    <p>-Selous' Zebra (Equus quagga borensis)</p>
    <p>-Grant’s Zebra or Boehm's Zebra, (Equus quagga boehmi)</p>
    <p>-Chapman's Zebra (Equus quagga chapmani)</p>
    <p>-Burchell's Zebra (Equus quagga burchellii)</p>
    <p>-Quagga (Equus quagga quagga)</p>
    <p>-Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra)</p>
    <h1>Appearance</h1>
    <p>All zebras have very short fur because they live in hot areas. Their fur has black and white stripes. The main
        part of the body has mostly vertical stripes, and the legs have horizontal stripes. They also have a dark line
        directly down their spine. Each of the different zebra species has different types of stripes. Each zebra has a
        unique pattern.</p>
    <p>Despite many attempts, we do not really know what the advantage is of having those characteristic stripes. There
        are different species and sub-species of zebra, and they all have stripes, so scientists think it must be
        important</p>
    <h1>Life</h1>
    <p>Zebras are social animals that spend time in herds, they graze together and sometimes even groom each other.
        They can have babies (foals) when they are about five years old and can have one every year. Zebras mainly eat
        grass, but they also eat fruit, leaves, and some vegetables. They always live near water and are an endangered
        species. </p>
