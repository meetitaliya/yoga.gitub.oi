    <h1>Gorilla Species:</h1>
    <img src="imges/gorilla.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>Gorillas are primates belonging to the family Hominidae. There are two main species of gorillas:</p>
    <h2>Eastern Gorillas:</h2>
    <p>Found in the forests of central and eastern Africa. This species is further divided into two subspecies: the
        mountain gorilla and the eastern lowland gorilla.</p>
    <h2>Western Gorillas:</h2>
    <p> Inhabit the forests of western Africa. This species is divided into the western lowland gorilla and the Cross
        River gorilla.</p>
    <h2>Habitat:</h2>
    <p>
        Gorillas live in diverse habitats, including lowland forests, montane forests, and bamboo forests. They are
        primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, shoots, fruits, and flowers.</p>
    <h2>Physical Characteristics:</h2>
    <p>Gorillas are known for their powerful build and strong arms. They have long, dark fur and prominent brows. Adult
        male gorillas, known as silverbacks, have silver-gray hair on their back, which is a sign of maturity and
        dominance.</p>
    <h2>Behavior:</h2>
    <p>Gorillas are social animals that live in groups called troops or bands. Troops are led by the dominant silverback
        male, and they consist of adult females and their offspring. Gorillas communicate through vocalizations,
        gestures, and body language.</p>
    <h2>Conservation:</h2>
    <p>Gorillas face significant threats to their survival. Habitat loss due to deforestation, poaching for the bushmeat
        trade, and diseases like Ebola are major challenges. Conservation efforts involve protecting their habitats,
        enforcing anti-poaching laws, and promoting ecotourism to raise awareness and provide benefits to local
        communities.</p>
    <p>Remember, this is just an example of detailed information about gorillas. You can expand on each section, add
        more facts, and provide specific details based on your needs and the level of detail you want to provide.</p>
