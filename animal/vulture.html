    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>Vultures can be found on every continent except Antarctica and Australia. They inhabit a wide range of habitats, including grasslands, forests, mountains, deserts, and urban areas.</p>
    <h2>Physical Characteristics:</h2>
    <p>Size: Vultures vary in size, with some species having wingspans of up to 10 feet or more.</p>
    <p>Featherless Heads: Many vulture species have featherless heads, which helps keep them clean while feeding on carrion (dead animals). This adaptation also prevents feathers from getting soiled in blood and other bodily fluids.</p>
    <p>Beak and Talons: Vultures have strong, hooked beaks and sharp talons that are well-suited for tearing into and scavenging carcasses.</p>
    <h2>Diet and Feeding Habits:</h2>
    <p>Scavengers: Vultures are primarily scavengers, meaning they feed on the remains of dead animals. They play a crucial role in cleaning up and preventing the spread of diseases by consuming carrion.</p>
    <p>Exceptional Sense of Smell: Some vulture species, particularly the Turkey Vulture in the Americas and the Old World vultures in Africa, Eurasia, and surrounding regions, have a keen sense of smell that helps them locate carrion from high altitudes.</p>
    <h2>Behavior and Social Structure:</h2>
    <p>Group Behavior: Vultures often gather in groups called "wake" or "committee" when feeding on a carcass. These groups can consist of multiple vulture species, and they often have a social hierarchy.</p>
    <p>Soaring Flight: Vultures are well-known for their soaring flight patterns. They use thermals (rising columns of warm air) to gain altitude without expending much energy. This ability allows them to cover large areas in search of food.</p>
    <h2>Conservation Status:</h2>
    <p>Many vulture species are currently facing population declines due to factors such as habitat loss, poisoning from consuming lead bullets in carcasses, and accidental ingestion of veterinary drugs administered to livestock. These declines have raised concerns about the ecological and public health impacts of reduced vulture populations.</p>
    <h2>Cultural and Ecological Importance:</h2>
    <p>Vultures have cultural significance in various societies. For example, they are considered sacred and are protected in some cultures, while in others, they are associated with death and decay.</p>
    <p>Ecologically, vultures play a vital role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by disposing of carrion and preventing the spread of diseases that can result from decaying carcasses.</p>
    <h2>Interesting Facts:</h2>
    <p>Some vulture species are known for their impressive soaring abilities. The Andean Condor, for instance, is one of the world's largest flying birds and can stay aloft for hours without flapping its wings.</p>
    <p>In some regions, vultures have faced threats from deliberate poisoning, as their scavenging behaviors can bring them into contact with poisoned bait intended for other animals.</p>
