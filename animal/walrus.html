    <h1> Walrus Overview:</h1>
    Walruses are large marine mammals known for their distinctive appearance and behaviors. They belong to the
    Pinnipedia order and are commonly found in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.

    <h1>Physical Characteristics:</h1>

    <p>Walruses have a thick layer of blubber that helps them stay warm in cold water.</p>
    <p> They are known for their long tusks, which are elongated upper canine teeth. These tusks can grow to be quite
        large and are used for various purposes, including digging for food and helping them pull themselves onto ice.
    </p>
    <p> Walruses have a moustache-like feature of stiff bristles on their upper lip, which helps them detect food in the
        water.</p>

    <h1>Habitat:</h1>
    <p> Walruses are typically found in cold, shallow coastal waters of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.
    </p>
    <p>They are known to spend a significant amount of time on ice floes and beaches, using them as resting platforms
        and places to give birth and nurse their young.
    </p>
    <h1> Diet:</h1>
    <p>
        Walruses are carnivores and primarily feed on a variety of marine invertebrates, with clams and other bivalves
        being a major part of their diet.</p>
    <p> They use their tusks to create holes in the ice and sea floor to access their prey.
    </p>
    <h1> Behavior:</h1>
    <p> Walruses are known for their social nature and are often seen in groups.
    </p>
    <p> They communicate using vocalizations and physical signals, such as body postures and movements.
    </p>
    <p> Walruses are excellent swimmers and can dive to great depths in search of food.
    </p>
    <h1> Conservation Status:</h1>
    <p> Walruses are considered vulnerable due to climate change and habitat loss. As sea ice melts, walruses are forced
        to spend more time on land, which can lead to overcrowding and increased competition for limited resources.
    </p>
    <p> Conservation efforts focus on protecting their habitats, managing human activities, and mitigating the impacts
        of climate change.</p>

    <h1>Cultural Significance:</h1>

   <p> Walruses have been important to indigenous Arctic cultures for centuries, providing food, materials for clothing
    and tools, and cultural significance.</p>

    <h1>Fun Fact:</h1>

<p>    Male walruses can weigh up to 1,500 kilograms (3,300 pounds) or more, making them one of the largest pinnipeds.
