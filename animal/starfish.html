<h1>Starfish (Sea Star)</h1>
<img src="imges/starfish.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Starfish, also known as sea stars, are fascinating marine creatures known for their unique appearance and behavior.</p>

<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Shape: Starfish have a distinct star-like shape, typically with five arms, although some species can have more arms.</li>
  <li>External Skeleton: They have a hard, calcified exoskeleton that provides structure and protection.</li>
  <li>Tube Feet: Starfish have tube feet on the underside of their arms that help them move, capture food, and attach to surfaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Habitat: Starfish are found in oceans around the world, inhabiting a variety of marine environments, from shallow waters to the deep sea.</li>
  <li>Movement: They use their tube feet to slowly crawl and navigate across surfaces, including rocks, coral reefs, and sand.</li>
  <li>Regeneration: Starfish have impressive regenerative abilities and can regrow lost arms or even an entire body from a single arm.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Starfish are carnivores and feed on a range of prey, including small fish, mollusks, and detritus, which they capture using their tube feet.</p>

<h2>Conservation Status</h2>
<p>Starfish populations can face threats due to habitat degradation, pollution, and climate change. Some species have experienced declines in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Water Vascular System: Starfish have a unique water vascular system that powers their tube feet and helps with locomotion and feeding.</li>
  <li>Autotomy: Some species of starfish can intentionally shed an arm as a defense mechanism when under attack, which can later regenerate.</li>
  <li>Ecosystem Role: Starfish play a crucial role in marine ecosystems by controlling populations of prey species and influencing community structure.</li>
</ul>
