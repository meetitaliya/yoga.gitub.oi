<h1>Beaver</h1>
<img src="imges/beaver.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Beavers are large rodents known for their impressive dam-building abilities and aquatic lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Size: Beavers vary in size, with adults typically ranging from 30 to 60 pounds in weight.</li>
  <li>Coat: They have thick, waterproof fur that keeps them warm in the water.</li>
  <li>Tail: Beavers have large, flat tails that help them swim and are used for communication and balance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Habitat: Beavers are found in North America, Europe, and Asia, inhabiting freshwater environments like rivers, lakes, and ponds.</li>
  <li>Dam Building: They are known for their construction of dams, which create ponds that provide protection from predators and easier access to food.</li>
  <li>Nocturnal: Beavers are primarily nocturnal, being more active during the night.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Beavers are herbivores and primarily feed on bark, leaves, aquatic plants, and the inner bark of trees.</p>

<h2>Conservation Status</h2>
<p>Many beaver populations have rebounded due to conservation efforts, but they still face some challenges, including habitat loss and conflicts with human activities.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Engineering Skills: Beavers are considered ecosystem engineers for their ability to modify habitats through dam-building.</li>
  <li>Dam Construction: Beavers build dams using sticks, mud, and rocks to create water barriers for their lodges and to create calm, deep water for easier access.</li>
  <li>Lodges: Beavers build dome-shaped lodges with underwater entrances, providing safety and warmth during the winter months.</li>
</ul>
