<h1>Snail</h1>
<img src="imges/snail.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Snails are slow-moving gastropod mollusks known for their spiral shells and unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Shell: Snails have a coiled, spiral shell made of calcium carbonate that provides protection and serves as a home.</li>
  <li>Body: Their soft bodies are covered by a mucus layer that helps them move and protects them from drying out.</li>
  <li>Antennae: Snails have one or two pairs of antennae that they use to sense their environment and detect food.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Habitat: Snails can be found in a variety of habitats, including gardens, forests, wetlands, and oceans. Some species are terrestrial, while others are aquatic.</li>
  <li>Movement: Snails move by gliding on their muscular foot, leaving a trail of mucus behind them. This mucus helps reduce friction and prevents drying.</li>
  <li>Hibernation: Some snail species hibernate in their shells during unfavorable conditions to conserve energy and avoid desiccation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Snails are herbivores, omnivores, or detritivores, depending on the species. They feed on a variety of foods, including plants, algae, and decaying matter.</p>

<h2>Conservation Status</h2>
<p>While snails are diverse and abundant, some species are endangered due to habitat loss, pollution, and other environmental factors.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Shell Direction: Snail shells coil in either a clockwise (dextral) or counterclockwise (sinistral) direction. Most snails are right-handed (dextral).</li>
  <li>Reproduction: Snails are hermaphrodites, meaning they have both male and female reproductive organs. They exchange sperm during mating.</li>
  <li>Escargot: Some snail species are considered a delicacy in certain cuisines and are known as "escargot."</li>
</ul>
