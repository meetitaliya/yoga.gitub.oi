<p>Woodpeckers are distinctive birds known for their strong beaks and drumming behaviors.</p>

<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Size: Woodpecker species vary in size, with some being as small as 3 inches and others reaching up to 20 inches in length.</li>
  <li>Beak: They have strong, chisel-like beaks that they use for drilling into wood to find insects and create nesting holes.</li>
  <li>Tail: Woodpeckers often have stiff tail feathers that help them balance while clinging to tree trunks and branches.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Habitat: Woodpeckers are found in a variety of environments, including forests, woodlands, and urban areas.</li>
  <li>Drumming: They use their beaks to drum on trees, creating loud and distinctive sounds that serve as both communication and territory marking.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Woodpeckers are omnivores, primarily feeding on insects and larvae that they find by pecking and drilling into tree bark.</p>

<h2>Conservation Status</h2>
<p>Many woodpecker species are considered to be of "Least Concern" in terms of conservation status. However, some populations may be affected by habitat loss and deforestation.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Head Protection: Woodpeckers have adaptations to prevent brain injury while pecking, including a shock-absorbing skull and a specialized hyoid bone.</li>
  <li>Tongue Structure: Woodpeckers have long tongues that can be extended to reach insects hidden within tree crevices.</li>
