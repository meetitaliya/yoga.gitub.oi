<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>

  <li>Quills: They have sharp quills on their back and tail that they can raise when threatened.</li>
  <li>Nocturnal Adaptation: Many porcupine species are nocturnal, being more active during the night.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Habitat: Porcupines are found in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and deserts, across different continents.</li>
  <li>Slow Movers: They are generally slow-moving animals, relying on their quills for defense.</li>
  <li>Herbivorous Diet: Porcupines are herbivores and feed on a variety of plant material.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Defense Mechanism</h2>
<p>Porcupines defend themselves by raising their quills and making their presence known to potential predators.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
