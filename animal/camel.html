<h1>Camel</h1>
<img src="imges/camel.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Camels are remarkable mammals known for their ability to survive in arid desert environments.</p>

<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Size: Camels vary in size, with adult dromedary (one-humped) camels standing around 6 to 7 feet tall at the shoulder.</li>
  <li>Humps: Dromedary camels have one hump, while Bactrian camels have two. The humps store fat, not water, which provides energy when food is scarce.</li>
  <li>Coat: Their coats help regulate temperature, with a heavy winter coat that is shed in warmer months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Habitat: Camels are native to desert and arid regions in Asia and Africa.</li>
  <li>Adaptations: They are adapted to desert life with features like tough hooves for walking on sand, a thick coat for temperature regulation, and the ability to drink large amounts of water at once.</li>
  <li>Social Behavior: Camels are social animals that often live in groups or herds, which can provide protection against predators.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Camels are herbivores with a diet consisting of desert vegetation, such as grasses, leaves, and dry shrubs.</p>

<h2>Conservation Status</h2>
<p>Wild Bactrian camels are critically endangered, while other camel populations are relatively stable. Domesticated camels are vital to the livelihoods of many human communities.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Water Storage: Contrary to popular belief, camels do not store water in their humps. Instead, the humps store fat that can be converted into energy.</li>
  <li>Shoe-like Feet: Camels have large, flat feet that help them distribute their weight on sand and prevent sinking.</li>
  <li>Domestic Use: Camels have been used by humans for transportation, carrying goods, and as a source of milk, meat, and wool.</li>
</ul>
